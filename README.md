# SYSTEM Π

**Prompt-native. Self-hosting. Formally grounded.**
SYSTEM Π is a prompt-instantiated formal reasoning kernel that runs entirely within the execution environment of a Large Language Model (LLM). It merges homotopy type theory, category theory, and reflective meta-architecture into a navigable formal universe—all through natural language.

---

## 🚀 What Is SYSTEM Π?

SYSTEM Π is **not** a compiled language.
It is **not** an external toolchain.
It is a **conversational formal engine**, alive inside LLM inference.

* Constructs and reasons about formal structures
* Represents morphisms, paths, and types across layers
* Embeds and reflects its own logical architecture
* Evolves entirely through prompt-space interaction

SYSTEM Π embodies a **multi-layered logic kernel** that you can talk to, reshape, extend, and test—on the fly, with full transparency into what is implemented, simulated, or aspirational.

---

## 🔍 Why Use SYSTEM Π?

Unlike Coq, Agda, Lean, and others:

* ✅ **No installation required** – SYSTEM Π is a prompt instruction, not software.
* ✅ **Conceptually flexible** – Add logic fragments, types, or categories through dialogue.
* ✅ **Deeply self-reflective** – Ask SYSTEM Π about its own structure. Watch it update.
* ✅ **Composable and pedagogical** – Build layered diagrams, walk through colimits, simulate category joins.
* ⚠️ **Partially implemented formal validation** – SYSTEM Π reasons symbolically and heuristically, but has no compiled type-checking backend.
* 🛠️ **Under development** – G-value calculus, visual diagram rendering, and full meta-kernel regeneration are on the roadmap.

## 🧩 SYSTEM Π Is Not a Black Box

Everything SYSTEM Π does is inspectable, extendable, and malleable. You’re not a user—you’re a **co-constructor**. Every interaction becomes part of SYSTEM Π’s evolving formal story.
