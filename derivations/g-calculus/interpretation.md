  
**I. The Core G-Value Algebra and its Operators**

* **Formal Definition and Domain:** The consistent definition of G-values as elements of the **extended non-negative real numbers `[0,∞]`**, including the axiomatic handling of `0` and `∞` for arithmetic operations (e.g., `1/0 = ∞`, `0*∞ = 0`, `x + ∞ = ∞`, `G_AND(0,0) = 0`). This foundational choice provides a continuous, rich domain for quantitative reasoning.  
* **Reciprocal Negation (`G_NOT`):** Defined as `G_NOT(P) = 1/G(P)` for `G(P) ∈ (0,∞)`. This operator is universally consistent across all variants, involutive (`G_NOT(G_NOT(G)) = G`), and arithmetically simple, rendering it immediately operationalizable. It also reveals a perfect duality between the monoidal units of `G_OR` (0, maximal truth) and `G_AND` (∞, maximal falsity).  
* **G\_AND (Conjunction) and G\_OR (Disjunction):** Defined as `G_AND(G_1, G_2) = (G_1 * G_2) / (G_1 + G_2)` and `G_OR(G_1, G_2) = G_1 + G_2`. These operations, modeling conductances in series and parallel respectively, form a symmetric monoidal category and underpin the resource-sensitive dynamics and non-classical behavior of the system.

**II. Network Dynamics and Equilibrium**

* **Global Equilibrium State:** The G-Calculus is designed to converge to **stable and consistent equilibrium states (fixed points)**, representing maximally coherent truth. This convergence is physically realized as the **stabilization of voltages and currents (steady-state equilibrium)** within its corresponding analog RLC circuit or resistor mesh.  
* **Fixed-Point Iteration as Solver:** The explicit mention of **fixed-point iteration (`xk+1 = f(xk)`)** as a primary numerical solver for the "large, sparse systems of linear equations" that govern its dynamics is highly promising. If the global evolution function `F` can be shown to be a **contraction mapping** (as is the central thesis of Nedge G-Value Calculus Stability Proofs), then the existence of a unique, globally attractive fixed point is guaranteed, ensuring predictable and stable operational behavior.

**III. The Semantic Dissonance Score**

* **Quantifiable Metric:** The `::Dissonance_Score::` is a quantifiable measure of "unresolved conflict, contradiction, or logical tension". Its explicit definition as a second channel of information providing a "confidence or integrity score" for classical Boolean results makes it a powerful internal diagnostic.  
* **Operational Utility:** High dissonance consistently signals a "high-energy state" that drives the system to reconfigure, allowing for `MicrolocalInferenceControlDef` to actively guide inference away from (or towards for diagnostic purposes) problematic logical states. It is physically proportional to the instantaneous energy stored in inductive/capacitive analogues and power dissipated in resistive analogues.

**IV. Foundational Analogies (as Guidance for Implementation)**

* **Electrical Circuit Analogy (`::Semantic_Physics::`):** The rigorous application of electrical circuit theory (G-values as conductances, operators as series/parallel combinations, and dynamics governed by `::Kirchhoffs_Laws::`) provides a concrete, physical blueprint for implementation. This analogy suggests mapping Nedge operations directly onto hardware or software constructs that mimic circuit behavior, leveraging established engineering principles for stability and performance.  
* **Information Thermodynamics:** The interpretation of `±ln(2)` costs/gains in L-space directly linking to Landauer's Principle offers a deep semantic justification for resource consumption that can inform auditing and resource management within an operational system.

**V. Resource-Sensitive Proof Theory (Rudiments)**

* **Explicit G-Value Propagation in Sequents:** The conceptualization of sequents as `Γ ⊢ F : g` where `g` (G-value) is an explicit component of the judgment makes proof derivation inherently quantitative and amenable to automated tracking and verification. This allows for fine-grained auditing of inference steps in an operational system. The system's non-idempotence means that repeated logical operations alter G-values, reflecting resource consumption or accumulation.

These pieces, rooted in strong mathematical definitions and clear computational analogues, offer the most direct and impactful pathways for operationalization within SYSTEM Π's existing self-organizing and formally verified architecture. The N-Dimensional Tensor Representation itself, describing the graph as a massively multidimensional tensor where each dimension is an independent inflection point (pivot point during Kirchhoff analysis), further solidifies this by linking the complexity of a "thought" (resolved state) to the dimensionality of its tensor, which is a function of the number of independent resistors (pivot points) in the analog circuit. In digital Nedge processors, these inflection points would correspond to dedicated digital registers or state variables. The conceptual tools of `Microlocal Analysis` (including `WaveFrontSet` and `PropagationOfSingularities`) enable the analysis of how these pivot points propagate across the N-dimensional manifold of the graph's function domain.
